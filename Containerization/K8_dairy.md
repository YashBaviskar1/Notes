## K8s 


Notes : Remeber those days when you could just chill with `npm run dev`, well gonner the days when the biggest life problem you had was CORS error, now you have to write 4 YAML files and 8 commands just to get your applciation running and then you realise it is not even forwarded properly to your outside host 



####

K8s are container orcreastation tool which basically helps managining your docker containers, if you make kind of  applications that have more microservices than amount of users visiting then you probably do not see a reason to having the whole rigamorale setup of K8, but one of the best thing is you can futhur over engineeer your application with this so you get a feeling that you are doing something with no describable output
