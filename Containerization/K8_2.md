**kubectl** : kube control, command line tool, to manage remote k8 cluster 


```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

| Minikube Driver                          | `kubectl` Available *Inside* Minikube VM?           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `virtualbox`, `hyperkit`, `vmware`, etc. | ✅ Yes (full VM includes kubectl)                    |
| `docker`, `podman`, `none`               | ❌ No (container is lightweight and missing kubectl) |




When you run `minikube start`, Minikube launches a **single-node Kubernetes cluster** inside a virtual machine (VM) on your local machine. When you run `minikube ssh`, you're logging **into that VM**. This VM behaves like a small Linux host that runs Kubernetes control plane components and worker node services via Docker containers.

---

### 📍 What You're Looking At

You're inside the **Minikube VM** as the `docker` user:

```
docker@minikube:~$
```

And when you ran `docker ps`, you saw a list of running containers. **These containers are the Kubernetes system components** running inside Docker. Let’s break down what you're seeing:

---

### 🧠 Key Components in the `docker ps` Output

Each line is a Docker container running a Kubernetes component:

| Container Name            | Role in Kubernetes                            | Notes                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `kube-apiserver`          | API endpoint for controlling Kubernetes       | Accepts `kubectl` commands                |
| `etcd`                    | Distributed key-value store                   | Used by Kubernetes to store cluster state |
| `kube-controller-manager` | Ensures cluster’s desired state is maintained | E.g., if Pod dies, brings it back         |
| `kube-scheduler`          | Decides which node runs which Pod             | Scheduler logic                           |
| `kube-proxy`              | Handles networking inside the cluster         | Manages service IPs and traffic           |
| `coredns`                 | Internal DNS service for Pods                 | Resolves service and Pod names            |
| `storage-provisioner`     | Helps create PersistentVolumes automatically  | Useful for testing PVCs                   |

You’ll also see `pause` containers — these are **"sandbox" containers** for Pods. Kubernetes uses a pause container as the namespace (network, IPC, etc.) holder, and other containers in the Pod join that namespace.

---

### 🔍 Why Does This Matter?

You're actually looking at the **control plane and node components** that make Kubernetes work — and they’re all implemented as Docker containers in Minikube. In a real, multi-node cluster, these would run across different machines.

By using `minikube ssh`, you now have **direct access to the node**, so you can:

* Inspect container logs (`docker logs <container_id>`)
* View the file system where Kubernetes stores data
* Interact with Docker directly

**All containers inside a Pod share the same IP address**
**Your nginx container is serving traffic on 0.0.0.0:80 in that Pod**
