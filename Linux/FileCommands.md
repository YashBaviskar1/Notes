### Answers 

1) `pwd` shows the current path of the current directory ("where am i" in the syste)

2) The command `mv file1 /dir/` -> moves the file one to the `/dir/`
whereas the command `mv /dir/file1 ,` --> brings that file from that specified `/dir/` to the current directory.

3) In order to recursivly copy a directory from one place as well as its contents inside it you can use `cp -r source_dir/ destionation_dir/` 

4) `.` indicates current dirctory where the terminal is pointing to, whereas `..` referes to previous directory with respect to current one
