Would you like me to **convert this into a practical quiz mode** next ‚Äî
for example, starting with a real-world problem like

> ‚ÄúYour container fails to start after build, logs show `/bin/bash not found`. What‚Äôs your debugging approach?‚Äù

and then progressively move through debugging, image optimization, and registry management ‚Äî as if you were *on-call for production deployment*?
That style is best if your goal is to reach *production debugging* proficiency.
